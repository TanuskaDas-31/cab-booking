            <p><i>The Ambassador Classic cabs have been a mainstay of Kolkata life since they first rolled onto the streets in 1958 . Built by Hindustan Motors until 20 14, they’ve been called “King of Indian Roads” due to their reliability and prevalence.Taxis are a very important aspect of Kolkata. In Kolkata only four people are allowed in a taxi.
                The metered-cabs are mostly of the brand Ambassador. Once in a while, Tata Indigo CS can be seen painted in yellow.These vintage yellow taxis are there for a long time now. They are non air conditioned. Many people use them as their main mode of transportation. From December 2013,under Gatidhara Scheme Of Government Of West Bengal, 
                a new fleet of no-refusal taxis had started to ply. Most of these taxis are air conditioned and are in white livery with a blue strip and AC Taxi mentioned on the door and roof of the car. The fare is same as in that of yellow taxis (same rate as flashed on the meter), except if driven with ac turned on, the passenger has to pay 25% extra of the displayed fare. So if the displayed fare is Rs. 50, the rate would be Rs. 63.</i></p>

                    <p> I wasn't familiar with the cab services in this city because I had just moved there. And since TANU Transportation System is a brand-new company, I considered trying it out.
                        When I went to their website, I was quite impressed. Then, after using their website to book a cab, I received a call from their customer service, and I was impressed by the man I spoke with.
                        Both the vehicle and the driver were excellent. You should use Sudrives for out-of-town taxi service, in my opinion. One of West Bengal's topmost cab services.</p>

                    <p> I had booked a ride with TANU Transportation System from Howrah to Bandel in the month of November. The driver reached the pick up point on time and I had a good ride to chetpet.
                        The driver also helped me in locating the address at Bandel where I had to alight. Given that I did not have sufficient cash due to some reasons, TANU Transportation was really courteous enough to extend the support by giving me an option to transfer the money later. 
                        The wonderful gesture from TANU Transportation System is highly appreciated. For someone who had visited Howrah for the first time, really appreciate the support extended by TANU Transportation System and surely recommend their services.</p>

                    <p>  First time I booked a cab from Kolkata Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International  Airport to Srerampore, for my mother and sister using TANU Transportation Service in West Bengal  on 21st September midnight. At this time I was out of station. 
                        My sister and my mother had not reached on correct time.I could not reach her phone. I called the customer care number of TANU Transportation System about the Drop information and the Customer person said "your family is dropped of at your house on correct time Ma'am. 
                        Just now driver informed to us" after that my sister spoke to me about all the information. Good 24/7 services. it was just unbelievably awesome. Thank you TANU Transportation System......</p>
